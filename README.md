<!-- Alternative: If App Passwords Option is Missing
If you can't find "App passwords" in your security settings, it might be because:

Your account uses more advanced security features
You need to enable "Less secure app access" (though this is deprecated)

In that case, try:

Search for "App passwords" in your Google Account search bar
Or go directly to: myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps! -->
